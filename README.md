# QECT
Quantum Error Estimation Tool

The tool traces through a quantum circuit and estimates error probability and suggests a location within the circuit for error correction. It considers both errors due to faulty gate operations and decoherence of the qubits. 
It is a generalised tool for any user specified quantum hardware or Physical Machine Descricption (PMD). 

We have considered Ion Trap (IT), Super Conducting (SC), Linear Photonics (LP), Non-linear Photonics (NP), Quantum Dot (QD) and Neutral Atom (NA) as
different quantum hardware or PMDs.
